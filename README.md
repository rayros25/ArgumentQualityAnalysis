# Argument Quality Analysis

This web app, when given an argumentative statement, is meant to provide a score between 0 to 1 assessing how strong/compelling that statement was.
It does so via a fine-tuned version of Google's BERT model.
The training set used was IBM's [Debater Arg Quality Rank 30k](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml#Argument_Quality).
